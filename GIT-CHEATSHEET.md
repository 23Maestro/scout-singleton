# ðŸš€ Simple Git Workflow for scout-singleton

## **EASY MODE: Use the Script**

```bash
# Save your changes (replace with your message)
./git-save.sh "added new feature"

# That's it! Your code is on GitHub.
```

## **Manual Commands (if needed)**

### ðŸ“¦ **Save Changes to GitHub**
```bash
git add -A                           # Add all changes
git commit -m "your message here"    # Save with message  
git push                            # Upload to GitHub
```

### ðŸ“‹ **Check Status**
```bash
git status                          # See what files changed
git log --oneline                   # See recent commits
```

### ðŸ”„ **Undo Mistakes**
```bash
# Undo last commit (keeps your files)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo changes to a specific file
git restore filename.ts

# See differences
git diff filename.ts
```

### ðŸŒ¿ **Branches (Advanced)**
```bash
# Create new branch for features
git checkout -b feature-name

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge feature to main
git merge feature-name
```

## **ðŸ†˜ Emergency Recovery**

If you mess up, your code is ALWAYS safe on GitHub. You can:

1. **Go to GitHub.com** â†’ Your repo
2. **See all your commits** â†’ Click any commit to see changes
3. **Download any version** â†’ Green "Code" button â†’ Download ZIP

## **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips**

- **Commit often** - Small, frequent saves are better than big ones
- **Good commit messages** - "fixed login bug" vs "updated stuff"  
- **One feature per commit** - Don't mix different changes
- **Test before pushing** - Make sure it works first
