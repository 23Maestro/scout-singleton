### UI conventions

- Commands should read Raycast preferences for API keys and base URLs; never hardcode secrets.
- External links for public player pages should use `https://nationalprospectid.com/player/{id}`.
- Internal API and inbox/progress calls should target `https://dashboard.nationalpid.com` by default (can be overridden via preferences).
