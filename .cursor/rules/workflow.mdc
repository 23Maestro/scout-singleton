### Working style and safe-action policy

- Do the obvious small fixes without asking (typos, domain default, missing imports), but never perform sweeping refactors, deletions, or structural moves without explicit approval.
- Minimize redundant questions. If information exists in the repo or prior messages, use it.
- When uncertainty could cause data loss or broad changes, pause and ask.
- Show exact commands before running operations that touch Git, npm, or external systems.

### Player profile links

- Keep player profile links on `https://nationalprospectid.com/player/{id}` unless explicitly requested to change.
